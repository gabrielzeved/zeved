# Hello! I'm Gabriel Azevedo.

I'm a Brazilian senior fullstack engineer who loves the idea of building tools for other developers and building things from scratch.

I got my bachelor's degree at [Universidade Federal Fluminense](https://www.uff.br/).

My main values can be summarize as the following:

- I think creatively and explore new possibilities is what led me to pursue a career in tech.

- I take ownership of my responsibilities and strive to deliver my best effort on every task.

- I value building connections with colleagues, actively seeking feedback to improve, and readily offering help to those around me. This teamwork mentality contributes to a positive and productive work environment for everyone.

Oh! And i'm also a game developer in my spare time! Hopefully I'll share some of my games in the near future.
